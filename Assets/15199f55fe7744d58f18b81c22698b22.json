We have connected the dots with Dr. Renaud and the platoon stationed at Orly International that a soldier came into contact with an infectious object and caused the fall of Paris. Dr. Renaud believes this disease is highly contagious and the military needs to take whatever action necessary to contain it. Due to this, the French Armed Forces will begin using flamethrowers to protect the non-infected people of France. We have to treat this with utmost seriousness as it goes against the Geneva Conventions.",
