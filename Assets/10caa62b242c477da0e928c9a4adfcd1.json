    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "My friend and eight others died yesterday in an accident involving our first anomaly. Its location is unknown, and now everyone is freaking out and Zackery is not happy…The thing is, I’m conflicted as to why he’s feeling so. It feels like he cares more about our schedule being put on pause rather than what happened. Regardless of this all, the most horrifying element is that if my hunch is correct, my friend’s daughter is now our 7th anomalous bioweapon."
