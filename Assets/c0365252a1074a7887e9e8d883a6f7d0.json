    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Fascinating... Once we cracked the first several symbols the rest came very easily. From what we can tell so far these etchings seem to be a recording of the tribe's history, of particular note is this large faded icon. It's composed of runes representing nighttime, whispers, a harvest and what they describe in the text as a \"soulcrystal\" of immense power activated by some sort of ritual. It was so powerful that even the most pure-hearted exposed would gradually be swayed to ruthless ambition. After a horrible incident the tribes were forced to unite and fracture it, each secretly encasing a piece in stone such that no one person should know the location of all the fragments. This tribe buried their part in a tomb guarded by their spirit ancestor \"Anastasia\". I'm interested to see if we can find this relic, however I'm sure it was purely of superstitious or traditional importance."
