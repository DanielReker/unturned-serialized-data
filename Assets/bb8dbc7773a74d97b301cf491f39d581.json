I warned him over and over again but he refused to listen to me. He is so focused on getting results- and heâ€™s the sole reason she became afraid of all of us. If he keeps this up, I can only see two outcomes here. Either she cracks and dies under the pressure, or she cracks and the next breach will be the end of us all."
