It was a tragedy that the tree next to him was chopped down, unable to protect him from that lightning that struck that night. I want you to know that he held a deep affection for you, and it wasn't an easy decision to keep you from the LLL group. We both believed that your past as a lumberjack might hinder your commitment to our pacifist ideals. ",
    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "However, circumstances have changed. So, Timmy, have you thought about the peace treaty? The Live Laugh Love group could use someone with your strength and resilience. We've lost a guiding light, but together, we can carry on his legacy, embracing the values he held so dear.<br><br>With hope for a peaceful future,<br><br>Cowherd Camlin"
