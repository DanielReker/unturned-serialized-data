After surveying the coastline we picked a relatively accessible oil rig to secure and begin helping survivors. Scouts are reporting that a large region North of Moscow is completely irradiated, so we'll have to be careful of the fallout. Reinforcements are already on their way to help us take a headquarters on the mainland, and several nuclear submarines in the area are rendezvousing with us here."
