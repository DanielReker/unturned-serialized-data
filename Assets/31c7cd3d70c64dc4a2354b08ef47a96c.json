Recently a ton of odd buildings have been popping up all over the island, so we decided to figure out what they are about! We simply walked up and requested an interview with a representative from the company. We were able to get that interview, apparently, the buildings belong to Vermillin, an international science & research organization originating in Western Colorado. The reason why they’re setting up shop on our island is due to them wanting to research the wildlife and volcanoes around here for ages, especially now that the volcanoes have woken up, and they recently were able to get the opportunity to do so. They’ve apparently been given permission from the Chilean government to drill into the volcanoes and research why they’ve been acting up lately. They also said they would be importing a ton of resources into the island, including extra food, so it looks like the “Food Crisis” has been averted for now. Many thanks to Vermillin for the interview, and good luck to them on the research!"
