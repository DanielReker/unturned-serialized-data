    "Description": "An audio tape diary.<br><color=#cd32da>Inspect To Play Audio Recording</color><br><br>\"Alright uh, John Mathews here, OH uh, today is uh… February 2nd I got a new progress update. Using one of our… subjects I finally got the chance to test it out properly a few weeks ago. It works far more interestingly on a human host, especially an alive one. Their eyes become… sunken, they don’t look very alive… but they certainly appear to be in other ways. I KNOW it’s not what Zackerson is after, and maybe it’s… NOT the answer for various reasons… BUT it might be closer to the answer we think! For instance, it can access the memories of its host! Other than the appearance and smell… and… It’s like you can barely tell from how they were before!\""
