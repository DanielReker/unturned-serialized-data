Said they're a collector of \"artifacts\" like that and to let them know directly if we find any more. Selling that piece of junk made more than this entire dig will and corporate doesn't need to know anything about it! The truck which picked it up was blank except for the license plate \"SCRP-7B\", aside from that I still have no idea who it was."
