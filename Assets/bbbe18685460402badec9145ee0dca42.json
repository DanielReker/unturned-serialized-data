    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Anomaly-1 is an unintended result of our DNA splicing experiment, transforming the subject into an extraordinary entity resembling a colossal living skeleton suspended from the ceiling. The lower body, concealed within the ceiling, remains unseen. Surrounding the creature, sharp bone protrusions emerge from the roof. Despite its apparent stillness, the extent of its abilities remains enigmatic. Caution is advised, as Anomaly-1 is considered highly hazardous, posing a significant threat should it ever break free. Further research is necessary to understand its capabilities fully."
