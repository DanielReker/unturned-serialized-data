    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "We've gotten reports of one of our agents had his plane crash up North. He appears to have survived the crash landing, but that's the only good news. ",
    "Interactability_Text_Line_3": "----------------------------------",
    "Interactability_Text_Line_4": "The Western weapon prototype he recovered has been lost in the crash, as the belly baggage compartment was completely destroyed. A bit of a shame for the operation to fail now.",
    "Interactability_Text_Line_5": "----------------------------------",
    "Interactability_Text_Line_6": "Another issue is the disguise the agent used. His disguise was based on the idea of a tourist caught in the middle of an infection, not a plane crash survivor. His fake character would realistically not be able to survive and escape such an event. At least he's okay, but now he's attracted a bit too much attention to come back inside."
