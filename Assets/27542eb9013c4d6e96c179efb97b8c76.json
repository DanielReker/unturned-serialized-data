    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Anomaly-5 is another unintended outcome arising from DNA splicing, exhibiting a formidable appearance as a gray entity adorned with prominently protruding bone wings. Distinguished by its luminous pink eyes and corresponding pink luminescence emanating from its wings, this anomaly poses a significant threat. Notably, it possesses the ability to envelop an area in dense fog, hindering visibility and impeding navigation. Furthermore, Anomaly-5 demonstrates a compelling capability for auditory mimicry, replicating the voices of individuals known to its target, evoking a siren-like allure. Remarkably, it can mimic voices of individuals beyond its expected knowledge range, amplifying the potential danger it presents. Comprehensive investigation is warranted to discern the full extent of Anomaly-5's abilities, ensuring appropriate countermeasures and safeguards are implemented to mitigate its hazardous nature."
