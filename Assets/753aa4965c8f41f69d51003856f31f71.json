    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Anomaly-3 is an unintended consequence of DNA splicing, resulting in a unique manifestation where the subject's skin takes on a plant-like green appearance and splits into two distinct entities. Initially appearing docile, these entities employ a deceptive strategy, luring unsuspecting individuals closer. However, upon proximity, Anomaly-3 exhibits aggressive behavior. The first entity splits its head and torso vertically, unveiling sets of sharp teeth on each side. Conversely, the second entity possesses a mouth that spans horizontally across its head, extending beyond the dimensions of a typical human mouth, which likewise exposes formidable teeth when opened. Close observation and caution are advised when handling or studying Anomaly-3, as its hostile response could pose significant risks."
