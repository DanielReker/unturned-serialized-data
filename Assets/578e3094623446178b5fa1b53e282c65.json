No identification was found surviving in the red sedan besides its own licence plate- which reads ‘DUK-745’. Local authorities were only able to recover cryptic dashcam footage which revealed that moments before the crash, a deer-like creature seemingly charging and colliding head on with the vehicle. Local authorities will be looking into the identity of the driver, and around the scene of the crash for any hints of the creature."
