We made sure to bring our outbreak suppression unit with us just in case things were worse than expected, how it was able to get away from us so easily is baffling. Unless it can turn invisible it must have either gone deeper into the caves than we previously thought, or it went straight into the ocean. One way or another it’s underwater.",
