We didn't know of course, it was just a few blips on the radar - could easily have been a suprise attack, and we gave them fair warning! Although in hindsite I doubt their comms use the same tech as ours. The one we recovered went down in New Mexico. The other one's lost, but I doubt there were any survivors. None of us expected it to be a flying saucer! The government's trying to play it down from the public, and the official account is that we rescued them after they crashed into an unidentified object.",
