    "Interactability_Text_Line_0": "Another flu epidemic, just in time for the Internationals, it is just fine! I didn't even want to watch the Internationals anyways... Well, it all started with a few tourists, suddenly everyone was starting to be sick, and then they called us, it is typical from the government to simply wait for the situation to get from bad to worse.",
    "Interactability_Text_Line_1": "Also, does anybody know what it is to take a shower? Geez, everyone who came here had a terrible smell, like they were walking corpses! The men in ZPD keeps telling us that it isn't a flu, but they got no power on us, they shouldn't even have the right to speak! At least we are being paid for being here, and I actually need that money, so as long as they do not interfere with my job, I will be happy, I can finally pay for some good food.",
    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "They don't get it, do they? For now it is just a flu, and nothing else! We want to keep it a secret for now, specially because the government wants the money that the Internationals could bring to the state, so many tourists will come, and they will buy stuff, and what the state doesn't need is some disease to stop the Internationals, so, for now it is JUST a flu and nothing else!"
