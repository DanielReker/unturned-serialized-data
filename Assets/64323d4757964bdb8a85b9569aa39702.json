She went through the first few phases perfectly fine, but all of a sudden something went wrong, and... Rainer, Alexandra, Hannah, Elliot, Hailey all died.

I wonder if it can feel pain, feel hurt…If it can die. If the answer to any of these questions is ‘no’, and we decisively conclude that, we’re on the right path."
