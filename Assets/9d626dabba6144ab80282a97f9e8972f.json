That junk the other company called \"equipment\" could barely do what we ordered it for, the only thing that it did was give us wrong data and break within the first weeks! The equipment from this \"Rexa\"  actually seems good, and I hope that it doesn't disappoint us as much as the previous company did. We are doing serious work here and bad quality equipment could ruin everything.",
