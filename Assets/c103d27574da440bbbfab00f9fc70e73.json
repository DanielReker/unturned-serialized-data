The government gave us no information regarding the infection, they simply instructed us to investigate if push came to shove. It seems like the water has been contaminated and we can't drain it because the pumps are clogged. One of those \"Spitter\" things or whatever they're called died in the pool and well, the water isn't safe for swimming to say the least."
