    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Welcome back to Rapa Nui post, today is the Second of April. A lot has been going on recently, and I hope we’re able to cover all of it. Most of the news we have today is on the darker side, but hopefully, I won't ruin your day with it. For starters, the end of the world! An infection originating from Washington State has begun to sweep the globe, countries all over the world have been hit by it, including, but not limited to; North America, Western, Central and most of Eastern Europe, The State of Hawaii, South America, and the British Isles. Due to how close the infection is to reaching Chile, the Chilean government has had to close down its borders and focus its efforts on keeping the infection out. Due to that Rapa Nui is being somewhat sidelined, meaning it’s unlikely we will see imports for a while, if ever. Teravaka has also somewhat violently, woke up. A number of houses have been burned down, some have even been split in half by the flow of lava."
