    "Description": "Valuable artifacts were lost due to complications obtaining and keeping them at the lab. There was a rumor that the artifact was acquired by the Belgian Military and never reached Florennes Military Base. The other artifact was said to be seen with a crazy farm owner that hasn't been identified. We have no information about the last artifact. Also \"Patient 222\" and \"Patient 245\" had escaped from the lab in the beginning of the outbreak. Terminate them for they are a major risk to Belgian survivors. The \"Patients\" were last seen at Charleroi Airport and Cheratte Quarry.",
