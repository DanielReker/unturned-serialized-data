    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Anomaly-6, an unintended outcome resulting from DNA splicing, exhibits a unique manifestation with complete paralysis of its body. However, it possesses the extraordinary ability of telepathic magnetism. To facilitate mobility, large chain-like arms have been securely affixed to its back, along with strategically embedded metallic components within its body. Notably, a notable side effect of its telepathic manipulation of metal objects is the generation of intense heat, leading to severe burns on the subject. Consequently, it is imperative to remove the chains when experimental testing involving Anomaly-6 is not in progress. Further investigation is essential to understand the precise mechanics behind its telepathic magnetism, while adopting rigorous safety measures to mitigate the risk of injury to both the subject and researchers."
