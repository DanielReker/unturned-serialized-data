The TRUE monsters here are the ones in this group, we are the true monsters, none of them see it. This group became a mess from the point in which the old leader threw 2 hordes beacons in 2 innocent cities. To fix it, I must end what made the problem even worse, I must end the Zombie Exterminators once and for all.",

Unfortunately the only way I see that I can end this problem is by using the same thing that made this problem even worse, a horde beacon. The camp will fall, nobody here is innocent, I can see it. They simply don't care anymore about life, they don't care about who they kill, a zombie, or a human.",
