    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Anomaly-4, a byproduct of DNA splicing, presents a highly perilous nature by adopting the guise of a scarecrow. Despite its seemingly immobile appearance, this anomaly possesses the ability to move, defying initial expectations. Of particular concern is its observed capability for multiplication, raising further uncertainties regarding its reproductive mechanisms. Currently, limited information is available regarding the full range of Anomaly-4's abilities. Extensive research is imperative to ascertain its complete spectrum of capabilities and to devise appropriate containment protocols, given its inherent dangers and propensity for unexpected behavior. Exercise extreme caution when handling or studying this anomaly, as underestimating its potential could lead to severe consequences."
