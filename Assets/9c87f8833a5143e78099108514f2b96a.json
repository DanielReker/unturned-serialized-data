Problem is, I factored in a miscalculation into my development, and now it’s a sentient wristwatch with a thirst for blood. We all have our quirks. Anyways, I had it on for months and the little [UNINTELLIGIBLE] developed needles that stuck into my arm and drank around half a litre of my blood over time. Couldn’t get it off for months. Apparently, it’s also a sadist, because it’s only after it sucked my blood that I realized it also wanted me to cut off my own hand. It wins this round, but I’ll be back, with a sentient hammer with a thirst for hour hands."
