If the Retaker's have anything to do with this, then we will declare war on them as well, those supplies that they were trading were valuable. We didn't loot that old abandoned military base far north for nothing, we want to gain something with those weapons, even water, but if they use those weapons against our men, then things will get a bit intense."
