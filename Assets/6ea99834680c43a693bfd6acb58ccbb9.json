The thing is, I agree with them. I'll be going to the Defenders camp, and I advise you to follow me. They aren't as strict as the Retakers, and aren't stuck to the past, like the Hazard Defenders. Not having a leader surely affected our group badly, no one stands to cheer us up, no one stands to keep our group united. By tomorrow morning I won't be around there anymore, having a leader now wont change the fate of this group, which is doomed to collapse. Goodbye, we might see each other again in the future, as enemies, friends, or maybe even allies.",
