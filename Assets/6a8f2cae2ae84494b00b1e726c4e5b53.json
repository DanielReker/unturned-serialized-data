With these… “Mega Turned” subjects, I have noticed a very strange pattern with them. The subjects that mutate that way tend to be for example, someone in a leadership role, or they have quite the physical strength. Could physical or mental strength be the deciding factor for this specific mutation to happen? Does it heighten the chance? Is it just a coincidence? I might look into this further someday.\""
