    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Our research indicates a significant divergence in vital organ functionality among the Turned gene splicing mutations. While the majority exhibit absence of heartbeat and non-functional lungs, an unexpected subset displays sporadic heartbeat and limited lung activity. Notably, this disparity extends to other vital organs, such as the liver, and kidneys, where functionality is inconsistent. These findings emphasise the complex nature of the mutations and underscore the necessity for continued research to comprehend their intricate biological nature."
