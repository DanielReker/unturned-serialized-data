    "Description": "The military and militia were in contention with eachother before the evacuation.  Emboldened by chaos they started fighting while the evacuations took place - creating more issues, and outright screwing themselves over by getting infected.  That being said, there are now stocks of equipment they've left out - and we can't leave them there.  We need you to destroy them with some charges.",
