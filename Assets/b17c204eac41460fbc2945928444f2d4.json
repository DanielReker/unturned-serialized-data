    "Message_0_Page_0": "Truthfully, our findings have been very minimal since we started last year. This, disease, is extremely advanced compared to others we've encountered. It's like someone opened Pandora's box of diseases, hence why we nicknamed it \"Pandora's Plague\". What kind of disease it is has been up for debate for a while now. The popular opinion here is that it is a virus, however it isn't any natural virus. Similiar to a virus, it has had a very high mutation rate generating special cases such as the zombies the soldiers have dubbed the \"cloakers\", the \"Spitters\", and the \"Megas\". Other edge cases have also been reported, the extent to which this disease can change the human form is astounding. Infact, it likely is some bioweapon made by some weapons manufacturer as that would explain a lot of it's characteristics. If that is the case, it is likely that it has some sort of kill-switch. At least, that is my theory, as why would you invent an uncontrolable weapon? I guess I can't really tell because if it <i>is</i> there, then it is really well hidden. The conversion from human to zombie is also surrounded with mystery. It has seemed to affect everyone differently. I can't honestly say why we haven't been infected yet. For all I know, we could all be ticking time-bombs waiting to reanimate. About the only good news I have is that we've been able to halt the death of some subjects by rapidly dosing them with some experimental substances. It is a very short time window that this is effective though. Take all I saw with a grain of salt, because as I said earlier, this is mostly all theories at this point. But yeah... that is about all I can share right now.",
