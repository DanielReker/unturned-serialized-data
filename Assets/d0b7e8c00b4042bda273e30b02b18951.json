    "Interactability_Text_Line_2": "Anomaly-2 is an unintended outcome of DNA splicing, resulting in sunken eyes and a recessed mouth, while its arms have transformed into vortex-like black holes reminiscent of tornados. Intriguingly, this creature possesses the remarkable ability to transport objects within a radius of approximately 500 meters, though the precise limits regarding size and weight remain unknown. Remarkably, Anomaly-2 exhibits docile behavior and can comprehend and follow instructions, facilitating its utilization for transporting various items within the laboratory. However, it is imperative to note that when removing this anomaly from its containment, proper communication and adherence to the appropriate containment protocols are vital to ensure safety and prevent any unforeseen consequences. Further study is required to fully comprehend the extent of its transporting capabilities."
