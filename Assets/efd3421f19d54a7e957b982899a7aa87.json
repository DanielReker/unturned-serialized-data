There’s no room for my old self anymore in this world, wolves and sheep, but I don’t enjoy being a wolf. It’s a facade, it all is, and always will be! It all looked so fake, but it felt so real, there’s no telling it apart, it felt like a movie but I was living my own life. Why do I do this? To protect myself? I need to find some better cases to work on."
