We dropped the ball hard enough that the other chairmen have decided to unanimously consider the bioweapon contracts due to how many times we’ve accidentally made them.

I suppose once our research is complete it won’t even matter- but what if we aren’t fast enough? I’ll have to think up something soon, and delay it for as long as I can."
