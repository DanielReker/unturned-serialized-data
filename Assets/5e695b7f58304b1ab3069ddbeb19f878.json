    "Description": "Legend has it that dragon scales are scattered around Belgium when The Beasts would roam around freely causing chaos wherever they went. I think I may have seen a man selling one at the farmers market in Brussels. There was also a possible siting of one of the scales washed up on Konnoke Beach. The last one was said to be in Southern Belgium buried in the river floor by an island.",
